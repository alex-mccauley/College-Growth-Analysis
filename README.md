# College-Growth-Analysis
Analysis and visualization of US college growth, correlated with local rent growth.

There are two parts: an iPython Notebook where all data analysis is done, and a web app that visualizes part of the data.  

The notebook is College Data Analysis.ipynb in the top-level directory.  
  The college class data are downloaded from http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx
  The rental data are from zillow.com

The web app runs with Flask in Python: /Visualization/app.py, and is adapted from a d3 visualization example here: https://becomingadatascientist.wordpress.com/tag/crossfilter-js/
